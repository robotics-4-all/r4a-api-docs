From here you can write applications that use a device's hardware, cloud services and generic functionalities. This is possible via the three distinct APIs (Robot, Cloud and Generic). Furthermore, you can write higher-level apps (FSM-like) using the TekNodes module. In this documentation you may find: Utilities: Various stuff, useful for writing applications. These are: Messages : How to give input and take output from services/API calls. Memory : How to store and retrieve variables/data from device memory Conditions : How to create conditions that use variables or constants Enumerations : What variables and enumerations are available Robot API : Calls to manipulate Robots and Devices Cloud API : Calls to get information from cloud services Generic API : Generic functionality like delays etc. FSM-like applications : How to write applications using an FSM-like way Examples : Various examples","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Welcome to R4A APIs!
