# Welcome!

Welcome to R4A APIs! From here you can write applications that use a device's hardware, cloud services and generic functionalities. This is possible via the three distinct APIs (Robot, Cloud and Generic). Furthermore, you can write higher-level apps (FSM-like) using the TekNodes module. In this documentation you may find:

- Utilities: Various stuff, useful for writing applications. These are:
    - [Messages](messages.md): How to give input and take output from services/API calls.
    - [Memory](memory.md): How to store and retrieve variables/data from device memory
    - [Conditions](conditions.md): How to create conditions that use variables or constants
    - [Enumerations](enums.md): What variables and enumerations are available
- [Robot API](robotapi.md): Calls to manipulate Robots and Devices
- [Cloud API](cloudapi.md): Calls to get information from cloud services
- [Generic API](genericapi.md): Generic functionality like delays etc.
- [FSM-like applications](nodes.md): How to write applications using an FSM-like way
- [Examples](examples.md): Various examples
